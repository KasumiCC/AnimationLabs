In this project I explored two animation techniques: keyframing and motion capture.

To prepare, I downloaded the model from the internet, then I did the rigging using blender's addon: rigify. 
I perfromed the armature deform with automatic weight to bind the rig with the character mesh, then did a bit weight painting for correction.


In the keyframing task, I first set up the IK constraints for my armature to make the legs easier to control. then I made different keyframe walking animations by posing the character.

In the moton capture task, I import the bvm files into blender, then manually transfer the data points in the motion capture file onto my armature. This would give a normal walking animation. I also explored in editing the motion capture data using blender's curve editor for different movements.
